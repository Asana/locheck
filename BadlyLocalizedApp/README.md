#  BadlyLocalizedApp

This example code demonstrates the dire consequences of _not_ using locheck. The main language, English, has correct format strings in `en.lproj`, and the translation, Australian English, has several errors that cause crashes at runtime if not addressed.

See `BadlyLocalizedApp/printLocalizationExamples.swift` for the code that runs the demonstration.
